TODO:
- Adjust framerate dynamically according to current game state
- Add FPS counter
- Allow adding a sprite to a GameMap's fieldBoundary also add to the master list of physicsSprites
- Find cause of one sided sprite collisions (sprite unaffected by collisions but other sprites bounce off when colliding)
- Implement faster PhysicsSprite iteration loop, one calculation per sprite pair (Complexity: O((N)(N+1)/2) )
- Design main menu screens
- Design JSON file reading system to automatically load game configurations
	* Could be very useful for organizing saved game states, menus, etc.
	* Would allow for some changes to be made to the game at runtime without recompile
	* Possible future uses:
		- Path to resources folder for ResourceLoader class read by file rather than hardcoded
- Create core code for shooting projectiles from ships (Done, will be merged in build soon)
- Design a sample level to showcase core functionality of the game
- Add pausing function to the main game loop
- Determine how specific sprites (such as ships, asteroids, buttons) know where to request their image
- Implement a timer-like system to execute events after a given interval of time
	* Allow this to be relative to amount of time of frames passed

####################

COMPLETE:
- Allow ActionButton text to scale with the image
	* Fix ActionButton text centering code
- Add support for isVisible
- Implement a redraw flag for sprites to indicate sprite's image should be redrawn
- Fix MapBoundary to only redraw image if needed
- Move ActionButton set position according to reference point to Sprite class
- Separate sprites into GUI sprites and ingame sprites
- Add class to contain GUI elements ingame
- Multithread the drawing and game update loops
- Multiple MapBoundary functionality (allowing for asteroid fields)
- Ability to toggle specific verbose debugging (to System.out)
- Remove DrawnFeature
- Autoscale the game graphics to the size of the user's window
- Develop level bounds and restrict objects to always stay within the map
- Resource loader class to automatically scan and load in resource files
	* Add ability to load test images by default or when there is an error
